GyroShell is a shell for Windows 11 (and maybe 10) that aims to provide a customizable and functional shell experience. The shells UI is written in WinUI 3 XAML, and the backend is composed of C#; all brought together by WASDK. 

> [!WARNING]  
> GyroShell is currently under heavy development and may not be stable.
